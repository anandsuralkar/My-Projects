_____________________________________________________Setup_________________________________________

#modules setup
firstly you would need python 3.7+ installed on your system and pip installed
If any of these modules not installed run pip install command in the command prompt
modules required:
	requests
	pymongo
	bs4 
run command promt and type command "pip install requests"
and similarly do for other packages

Or you can do just run command prompt in project root folder ie folder named "News ste scrapping" and run command :-
"pip install -r requirements.txt"
and all packages will be installed.


#mongodb setup

You need mongodb installed ony your system,
and also have mongodbcompass for checking out database.


#Setting up local host
create local host in your mongodb compass and update host and and port accordingly if needed

If mongoDB cloud is needed instead i have setup mongo db cloud to contact me for that

_____________________________________________________Running script__________________________________

run main.py file in python console
And if everything goes correctly you will see confirmation of entries in your local mongoDB
check out MongoDBCompass for accessing created Databases.

thanks you for reading.
